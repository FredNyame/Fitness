      <p>Since day one, my priority has been to help people transform themselves. Over time, my schedule has gotten busier, and so for a little while, I did take this service off — but only so
        I could reevaluate the way I approached it and offer it in an even more engaging way.</p>
      <p>I want to make sure I never lose sight of my primary goal, which is to personally help people transform their lives.
        In the interest of a more personal touch, I’m only going to be taking a handful of clients at a time. With this new approach,
        I’m going to be focusing on giving a select group of individuals the most personal experience possible in the online coaching world.
        I wish I could accept all inquiries,
        but I can’t stress enough how I want to make sure those I’m working with are taken care of, by me, personally. </p>
      <p>Regardless of what the response may be — whether we’re able to work together or not — I’ll be in touch with you within 24-48 hours. But by all means, I absolutely encourage you to inquire below.
         You can read the details below for more information.
         I’m looking forward to hearing from you!</p>

           know, and we’ll go over the details there.</li>

          For all clients, replies to questions and general

        <li>If we’re able to work together, we will be in contact multiple times per week. I’m committed to offering you as personal of a service as I can, and
